SDP

Requirements: 
	- implement a generic leftist heap.
	- create schedule comparing Startime, deadline and duration and run schedule to find what jobs finish first.

implementation:
	- Create a leftist heap based on the priority i want to compare. these compareTo functions  will be based on which part of the schedule i want to compare.
it could be Startime, deadLine or duration. each compareTo will reside in its on Task file that extends the Original Task.

	- Create 3 Task files (Task1,Task2,Task3) with overriding compareTo methods.

	- Create Scheduler file that builds the schedule.

		- run a while loop to pull the min value from the leftist heap, once min itemis removed subtract one from the duration then check if the job is finished
		if the job is finished print item else insert it back into the leftist heap.

		- keep a counter of the Time, each iteration is 1 min.

		- to keep track of number late and total number of late time create two more counters to keep track of those.
